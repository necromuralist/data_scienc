This plot shows the unemployment rate for the Portland-Hillsboro-Vancouver area (in Oregon and Washington State) from January 2007 through February 2017. I want to answer the questions - *How has Portland's unemployment rate changed over the last ten years and how does it compare to the national unemployment rate?* Additionally, I'd like to see how well this metric follows the *S&P 500 Index* and the *Housing Price Index*.
