#+TITLE: Network Connectivity

This will go through the process of importing and analyzing an internal email communication network between employees of a mid-sized manufacturing company. 
Each node represents an employee and each directed edge between two nodes represents an individual email. The left node represents the sender and the right node represents the recipient.

* 1 - Load the Directed Multigraph

Using networkx, load up the directed multigraph from `email_network.txt`. Make sure the node names are strings.

*This function should return a directed multigraph networkx graph.*

How many employees and emails are represented in the graph from Question 1?

* Information Routes

** Part 1. Assume that information in this company can only be exchanged through email.
   When an employee sends an email to another employee, a communication channel has been created, allowing the sender to provide information to the receiver, but not vice versa. 

   Based on the emails sent in the data, is it possible for information to go from every employee to every other employee?

** Part 2. Now assume that a communication channel established by an email allows information to be exchanged both ways. 

   Based on the emails sent in the data, is it possible for information to go from every employee to every other employee?

*This function should return a tuple of bools (part1, part2).*

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session networkconnectivity :results none
def answer_three():
    """decides connectivity based on emails
